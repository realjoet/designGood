                        We've entered a radical stage of innovation in which a very small percentage of the larger population is literate in the skills necessary to particpate. This disparity in knowledge is already leading to a disparity in opportunity and innovation that will only get worse if we allow it to continue.

                        As a non-profit focused on technical literacy and education, one of the most important parts of our mission is improving technical literacy around the globe. In order to achieve this goal, 25% of all profits will be donated to youth education programs focused on improving technology literacy.

                        At this point in history automated systems are now governing the world, impacting the lives of millions, if not billions, of people around the globe. With this in mind, the creators of these automated systems — the people making the decisions about how life is logically assessed — should begin to be thought of as government representatives to their user base of constituents.  It is time we take this responbility more seriously, and for this reason Design Good has created a pledge of commitment to creating good.

                        What we are experiencing today is not so different than other events in historical periods. The American Revolution was fought by the people for no taxation without representation. This modern movement is also about representation of the people, but this time around we should be focused on <strong>no implementation without representation</strong>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
