                    <p class="section-description">
                        We’re entering an era of ambient computing, where artificially intelligent machines driven by mass amounts of data are going to be monitoring the world around them, consuming data as if they were human and acting on the information they receive, on our behalf. The problem with this is that more often than not these operations are performed in a way that is invisible to the general public, hidden behind an algorithm that operates in a cloud server somewhere in the middle of, well, nobody really knows.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As former and active technologists with experience working for some of the largest technology organzations in the world, we understand the problems that may arise from the rapid evolution of technologies we're experiencing right now. We also know what kind of impact may result from companies hiding behind their algorithm and are aware of the need for public involvement.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For these reasons and more, we decided to launch Design Good, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization on a mission to create a better future, through technology. We believe this requires a two-sided approach, which is to (1) help improve both data and overall technical literacy within the general population and (2) provide technologists with knowledge and tools that enable them to create products that not only respond to informed consumer demand but also create positive social impact while still increasing revenue.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We believe approaching our mission with these two sides in mind will allow them to work together synergistically and catalyze the  changes that need to be made.

                        Automating Humanity is an insider's perspective on everything Big Tech doesn't want you thinking about — everything from the impact being created by the addictions they have installed at a global scale, to the profits being driven by fake news and disinformation, to the way these companies are manipulating the world for profit and automating jobs at a scale we've never experienced before.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If you're looking for a book that reveals trade secrets, this is the wrong book for you. But if you're looking for an insider's perspective on the industry written in a way anyone can pick up and enjoy, this is the book you've been looking for. Even without giving away secrets, there's plenty to be told.
