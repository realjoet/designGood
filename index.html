                        We’re entering an era of ambient computing, where artificially intelligent machines driven by mass amounts of data are going to be monitoring the world around them, consuming data as if they were human and acting on the information they receive, on our behalf. The problem with this is that more often than not these operations are performed in a way that is invisible to the general public, hidden behind an algorithm that operates in a cloud server somewhere in the middle of, well, nobody really knows.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Design Good understands the problems that may arise from this rapid evolution of technologies and what kind of impact may result from companies hiding behind their algorithm. This is why we decided to launch Design Good, a non-profit experience design research foundation focused on helping people around the world create positive social impact, through technology.
