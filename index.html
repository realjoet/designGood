                    <p class="section-description">
                        We’re entering an era of ambient computing, where artificially intelligent machines driven by mass amounts of data are going to be monitoring the world around them, consuming data as if they were human and acting on the information they receive, on our behalf. The problem with this is that more often than not these operations are performed in a way that is invisible to the general public, hidden behind an algorithm that operates in a cloud server somewhere in the middle of, well, nobody really knows.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As former and active technologists with experience working for some of the largest technology organzations in the world, we understand the problems that may arise from the rapid evolution of technologies we're experiencing right now. We also know what kind of impact may result from companies hiding behind their algorithm and are aware of the need for public involvement. For these reasons and more, we decided to launch Design Good, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization on a mission to create a better future, through technology.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        We believe this requires a three-part approach, which is to (1) help improve both data and overall technical literacy within the general population, (2) enable technologists to create products that not only respond to informed consumer demand but also create positive social impact and increase revenue, and (3) help policymakers understand what's happening in order to create regulation that not both protects consumers and enables businesses to operate successfully.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We believe approaching this effort with these three sides in mind will allow them to successfully work together, catalyzing the changes that need to be made. And so far it seems to be working, as our work has been featured in:

                    <p class="section-description">One of the biggest problems with the Internet is that there are so many flaws, but nowhere to report a complaint.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Think about how the process of reporting these pain points works now. If you have a problem with an app, a website, spam email, etc., where do you go? Are you going to file a complain with the police? They'll laugh at you. Are you going to tweet about it? Hopefully you have a solid influencer status. Are you going to email the company directly? Good luck getting to the people who make decisions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now you can report here.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From this data we can then host complaints for everyone to see and leverage our network to reach the people building the companies in order to make social responsibility a priority within the companies creating the problems.

Toscano will then critically analyze these issues and suggesting how we can create proactive, adaptable regulation that satisfies both the needs of consumer safety and commercial success in the international economy.
