                    <p class="section-description">
                        Modern digital technologies have swept the world before we've had a chance to understand them. And because of their wreckless pace of growth we now live in a world full of tech addictions, accelerating rates job displacement, and powerful forms of invisible social engineering, among many other threats.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As former and active technologists, regulators and changemakers with experience working for some of the largest technology organzations in the world, we understand the problems arising from the rapid evolution of technologies we're experiencing right now. We also know what kind of impact can be expected from companies hiding behind their algorithm. For these reasons and more, we decided to launch BEACON, the Better Ethics and Consumer Outcomes Network.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our for-profit initiative, BEACON Labs, works to translate technologies ethical dilemmas into positive-sum business solutions. Our non-profit initiative, BEACON Institute, works to educate and accelerate communities around the globe through active participation.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We believe approaching this effort this way is the only way to successfully make the changes that need to be made. And so far it seems to be working, as our work has been featured in:

                    <p class="section-description">One of the biggest problems with the Internet is that there are so many flaws, but nowhere to report a complaint.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Think about how the process of reporting these pain points works now. If you have a problem with an app, a website, spam email, etc., where do you go? Are you going to file a complain with the police? They'll laugh at you. Are you going to tweet about it? Hopefully you have a solid influencer status. Are you going to email the company directly? Good luck getting to the people who make decisions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now you can report here.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From this data we can then host complaints for everyone to see and leverage our network to reach the people building the companies in order to make social responsibility a priority within the companies creating the problems.

                                  This talk, given by former Google consultant Joe Toscano, will give you an insider's perspective on everything Big Tech doesn't want you thinking about: everything from the addictions installed on a global scale to the profits being driven by fake news and disinformation, to the way they’re manipulating the world for profit and using our data to train systems that will automate jobs at an explosive, unprecedented scale. Toscano will then critically analyze these issues and suggesting how we can create proactive, adaptable regulation that satisfies both the needs of consumer safety and commercial success in the international economy.

                                  Computers, smartphones, tablets—all sorts of connected devices—are invading our lives and the lives of our children like no other point in history. This is changing the way we interact with each other, the way business is done, and, most importantly (and concerning), the way we raise our kids.
