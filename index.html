                    <p class="section-description">
                        We’re entering an era of ambient computing, where artificially intelligent machines driven by mass amounts of data are going to be monitoring the world around them, consuming data as if they were human and acting on the information they receive, on our behalf. The problem with this is that more often than not these operations are performed in a way that is invisible to the general public, hidden behind an algorithm that operates in a cloud server somewhere in the middle of, well, nobody really knows.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As former and active technologists with experience working for some of the largest technology organzations in the world, we understand the problems that may arise from the rapid evolution of technologies we're experiencing right now. We also know what kind of impact may result from companies hiding behind their algorithm and are aware of the need for public involvement.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For these reasons and more, we decided to launch Design Good, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization on a mission to create a better future, through technology. We believe this requires a three-part approach, which is to (1) help improve both data and overall technical literacy within the general population, (2) enable technologists to create products that not only respond to informed consumer demand but also create positive social impact and increase revenue, and (3) help policymakers understand what's happening in order to create regulation that not both protects consumers and enables businesses to operate successfully.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Think of us like the <a href="https://www.bbb.org/en/us/mission-and-vision" target="blank">Better Business Bureau</a>, but for the Internet. We are not out to shut any of these businesses down or push for regulation that will stifle innovation, but instead we are here to help consumers feel safe and to help businesses regain and maintain trust—a currency worth more than any other.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We believe approaching this effort with these three sides in mind will allow them to successfully work together, catalyzing the changes that need to be made.

                        Automating Humanity is an insider's perspective on everything Big Tech doesn't want you thinking about—everything from the impact being created by the addictions they have installed at a global scale, to the profits being driven by fake news and disinformation, to the way these companies are manipulating the world for profit and automating jobs at a scale we've never experienced before.
                        <br />

                        If you're looking for a book that reveals trade secrets, this is the wrong book for you. But if you're looking for an insider's perspective on the industry written in a way anyone can pick up and enjoy, this is the book you've been looking for. Even without giving away secrets, there's plenty to be told.

                                  Conversational interfaces have exploded over the past couple years as AI and ML capabilities have rapidly expanded. There have been a lot of great experiments, but not many that have stuck around. That doesn't, however, mean conversational interfaces are dead, it just means they haven't been implemented the right way.

                                  New technologies and the algorithms that reside within them have become the governing bodies of the world. These systems shape the way millions, if not billions of people around the globe behave, think, and operate as a global society. This being said, the people creating these systems have become the modern government representatives to their user base of constituents.

                                  <br />
                                  What we will talk about is the power that resides within these systems, why regulation is an important part of the future of this industry, how it will effect business/jobs, and where it may be headed in the future. This talk will help everyone understand the role they play and the responsibilities that come with it.

                                  A long time staple of futurists and science fiction authors, and the preserve of data scientists and machine wyl--learning experts, the promise of artificial intelligence and cognitive computing is now vastly more accessible via numerous "AI as a service" platforms.
