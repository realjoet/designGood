                        We’re entering an era of ambient computing, where artificially intelligent machines driven by mass amounts of data are going to be monitoring the world around them, consuming data as if they were human and acting on the information they receive, on our behalf.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The problem is that more often than not these operations will be performed in a way that is invisible to the general public, hidden behind an algorithm that operates in a cloud server somewhere in the middle of, well, nobody really knows.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We at Design Good understand the problems that may result from this rapid evolution of technologies and what kind of impact may result from companies hiding behind their algorithm, treating it as if it does no wrong. This is why we decided to launch Design Good, a non-profit research foundation focused on helping people around the world create positive social impact, through technology.

                                    Our field is constantly changing, where last year's cutting edge is this year's commonplace, and today's best practice is tomorrow's old hat. For well over a decade, we've tracked practices, patterns and technologies to keep our audience up to date.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <a href="https://twitter.com/webdirections">Web Directions</a> Summit brings together the whole team, with two curated tracks, one focused on development and engineering, one focused on design. For this, we've brought together the finest minds at the intersection of technology and design, in an atmosphere unlike any other.
